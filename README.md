This is a ColdFusion CFC used to connect to UPS API using OAuth.

## API's Supported:
 * Rate

To authenticate with the UPS API, use your application's OAuth ID and SECRET. If you don't have these credentials, setup your application from https://developer.ups.com.

## Initialization

This will init the cfc and setup testing or production URL.

**CreateObject()**

	variables.upsapi = CreateObject('component', 'upsapi').init(developmentServer=true);

**New Keyword**

	variables.upsapi = New upsapi(developmentServer=true);

## Sample Usage

See upstest.cfm.

Steps:
	1. Retrieve site token. This is not a user specific token requiring them to login to UPS.
	(Store token and expiration somewhere you can retrieve such as a DB. Sample just uses a cookie. You can the use same key until expiration where you will need to get a new token)
	2. Create 2 structures. First is the request parameters. Second is the structure using case specific keys for the request JSON. See API documentation for key names.
	3. Call api passing token, parameter structure, and request structure.

## Response

Result for API will be structure from the deserialized JSON.
